# ClickPilot progress

Updated: 21 October 2026.

## Current status

Planning: REVIEWED — user approved starting milestone 1.  
Milestone 1: AWAITING USER VERIFICATION.  
Next proposed milestone: 2 — Safe compact DOM observation; not approved.

The user explicitly authorized milestone 1 on 21 October 2026. The foundation is implemented, automated checks pass, and Chrome verification is pending.

## Completed planning work

- Read `AGENTS.md` in full and adopted its coding, privacy, testing, and human approval requirements.
- Read `docs/clickpilot-production-architecture.md` in full. `docs/architecture.md` is absent; the existing architecture document remains unchanged.
- Created `PLAN.md` with independently verifiable milestones, likely file ownership, acceptance criteria, automated-check expectations, numbered manual steps, and approval gates.
- Split backend validation from real Gemini integration, and outcome verification from lifecycle recovery, to keep changes reviewable.
- Kept screenshot fallback optional, permissions incremental, and safety checks part of each relevant slice.

## Evidence and limitations

### Milestone 1 implementation

- Added a pnpm workspace with one WXT extension package, pinned dependencies and lockfile, strict TypeScript, ESLint, and a production build script. WXT is needed to build the MV3 extension; React renders the panel; TypeScript checks source; ESLint checks code quality. No Tailwind or test framework was needed for this first slice.
- Added a Chrome MV3 background entrypoint that enables toolbar click to open the side panel. Added a React side panel with an honest foundation state and plain CSS. It contains no working guidance controls or page access.
- Added `.gitignore` for dependencies and WXT output. Updated the README with actual install, check, build, and Chrome loading steps.
- WXT automatically adds `sidePanel` for its side-panel entrypoint. The only explicitly requested permission is `activeTab` for the toolbar activation flow that milestone 2 will use. The built manifest has exactly `activeTab` and `sidePanel`, and no host permissions or content scripts.

### Milestone 1 checks

- `corepack pnpm install` — exit 0; installed 230 packages using pnpm 10.34.7 and generated `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- `corepack pnpm typecheck` — exit 0 after correcting the local Corepack script and TypeScript config. It runs `wxt prepare && tsc --noEmit` with strict mode.
- `corepack pnpm lint` — exit 0; ESLint reported no errors.
- `corepack pnpm build` — exit 0; WXT 0.21.4 built `apps/extension/.output/chrome-mv3` for Chrome MV3.
- A Node inspection of the production output — exit 0; asserted MV3, side-panel path, toolbar title, exact `activeTab`/`sidePanel` permissions, no host permissions/content scripts, background `openPanelOnActionClick`, and no `AIza`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `captureVisibleTab`, or `executeScript` markers.
- Initial `corepack pnpm typecheck` and `corepack pnpm build` runs failed because root scripts invoked a missing standalone `pnpm`; root scripts now invoke Corepack. A later typecheck failed because the TS config `extends` path lacked `./`, JSX was unset, and direct `chrome` types were absent. Those issues were corrected and the final commands above passed. The first typecheck and build also ran concurrently against WXT's generated files; final checks ran sequentially.
- Unit tests: NOT RUN; no pure behavior exists yet, so adding a test that mirrors static render code would add little value. Vitest is planned for milestone 2.
- Playwright/browser automation: NOT RUN; scheduled for milestone 2 when page interaction begins. Static checks cannot prove that a user sees the panel.
- Manual Chrome verification: NOT RUN by the agent. The user must load the unpacked extension and inspect the live panel before this milestone can be approved.

### Earlier planning evidence

- `cat AGENTS.md` — exit 0; read project instructions.
- `rg --files --hidden -g '!.git/**' -g '!node_modules/**' -g '!.agents/**' -g '!.codex/**'` — exit 0; initial project inventory contained only `AGENTS.md` and `docs/clickpilot-production-architecture.md`.
- `cat docs/clickpilot-production-architecture.md` — exit 0; read architecture.
- Documentation structure check — exit 0; verified 10 milestone sections, corresponding ledger/manual verification entries and approval gates, and the architecture filename. A repeatable summary check passed with this exact command:

  ```sh
  python3 -c 'from pathlib import Path; p=Path("PLAN.md").read_text(); s=Path("PROGRESS.md").read_text(); assert p.count("## Milestone ")==10; assert p.count("**Gate:**")==10; assert "AWAITING USER VERIFICATION" in s; print("PASS: 10 milestones, 10 approval gates, pending verification status")'
  ```

- `cat README.md` — exit 0; reviewed the README that appeared after the initial inventory. It remains unchanged; its broad roadmap is consistent with the plan, while its architecture path and Tailwind reference retain the differences noted in `PLAN.md`.
- At the planning stage, typecheck, lint, unit tests, browser tests, and build could not run because no application existed. Milestone 1 check results are recorded above.
- External API details, model availability, quotas, prices, and provider terms: NOT VERIFIED. Verify current official sources during the relevant approved implementation milestone.
- At the planning stage, Git status resolved through an unrelated ancestor repository under `/Users/anantjain`. On 21 October 2026, the user explicitly authorized adding the ClickPilot GitHub remote and pushing milestone 1 to a `milestone-1` branch, with only relevant ClickPilot files. A project-local Git repository is required to keep the ancestor repository untouched. This permission does not approve merging into `main`, publishing, or later milestone work.

## Remaining decisions and limitations

- Verify milestone 1 in Chrome. If a check fails, fix this milestone and rerun checks. Do not begin milestone 2 until the user confirms milestone 1 and explicitly approves milestone 2.
- Architecture filename differs from the requested path. Future work should read the existing source named above unless the user chooses to rename it.
- Browser permission and lifecycle behavior must be verified against real Chrome; passing pure-function tests alone is insufficient.
- Live Gemini testing later requires backend-only credentials and an account with the selected model available. Public hosting requires separately approved deployment and demonstrated abuse/budget controls.
- No milestone is complete until the user confirms verification. Approval of milestone 1 did not authorize later milestones.

## User verification for milestone 1

1. From the project root, run `corepack pnpm install` and `corepack pnpm build`. Open `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer mode, click **Load unpacked**, and select `apps/extension/.output/chrome-mv3`. Expect a ClickPilot extension card with no load errors. A red **Errors** button signals failure.
2. Open an ordinary website and click the ClickPilot toolbar icon. Expect exactly one side panel showing **Find your way around.**, the **Foundation build** label, and the text that page guidance is not yet available. A blank panel, duplicate UI, or missing panel is a failure.
3. Close and reopen the panel, then reload ClickPilot on `chrome://extensions` and click its toolbar icon again. Expect the same idle panel each time. If it fails, use the extension card's **Inspect views** service-worker console and the side panel's Inspect console to identify errors.
4. Check the page itself and the Network panel. Expect no page mutation and no backend/model requests caused by opening ClickPilot. Any unexpected action or request is a failure.

After user confirmation, mark milestone 1 complete and separately request approval for milestone 2. For each later milestone, record actual files, commands/results, manual evidence, remaining issues, and the user's approval.
